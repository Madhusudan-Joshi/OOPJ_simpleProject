# OOPJ_simpleProject
As a part of my course Object oriented programming with Java I tried to accumulate all the concepts and simulated a simple text based virutal assistant to carry out some tasks
Start,internet and applewatchsiri are three packages used in the project.
wakeUp class in the Start package is the starting point of the program
